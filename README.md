# Constraints-Analysis

**Last Updated: 22/03/2022**

<br>The files provided here are example notebooks exploring analysis of constraints in the NEM for various scenarios using additional functionality that has been adapted (forked) from the offical release of nempy, a NEM dispatch simulation tool.

This repo will be continuously updated with more examples and improvements to the constraints implementation within the forked version of nempy.

There are also aims to integrate this into the official release of nempy, once test have been validated etc.

**Current Examples**
- "example_a":              Investigates single dispatch interval constraint demonstrating constraints analysis functionality.
- "example_a_timeseries":   Follows the above example but across multiple dispatch intervals.
