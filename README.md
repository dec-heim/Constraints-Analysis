# Constraints-Analysis

**Last Updated: 09/03/2022**

<br>The files provided here are currently **draft** notebooks that are largely incomplete and missing text sections.

This repo will be continuously updated with more examples and improvements to the constraints implementation within the forked version of nempy.

There are also aims to integrate this into the official release of nempy, once test have been validated etc.
