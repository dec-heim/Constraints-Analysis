    "# NEMPY Constraints Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=green>Jupyter Notebook <br>Version: 1.0, Draft Notebook <br>\n",
    "Author: Declan Heim <br>\n",
    "Contact: __[Email](mailto:d.heim@unsw.edu.au)__<br>\n",
    "GitHub Ref: __[nempy_constraints_v1](https://github.com/dec-heim/nempy_constraints_v1)__</font>\n",

    "## Introduction & Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as an example of how constraints can be analysed using the open-source python simulator of AEMO's dispatch process, 'nempy'. This tool was initially developed by Nick Gorman and is expanded upon in this example, with additional functionality to draw insights into the impact of specific constraint equations in historical dispatch. These changes are not yet available via the official nempy release through pip, rather it draws on a forked version of the github repo. Updates to integrate and streamline these features into the official release of nempy are in progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of analysing constraints in this regard is to convey a deeper understanding and discussion around the impact of constraints to those units involved in the constraint. Further, this example demonstrates the outcomes that could be seen in the market by alleviating a specific constraint, both in a market price sense and the volume (MW) dispatched for each unit in the constraint. This type of analysis is possible by re-simulating the same dispatch interval and modifying the inputs that define the historically binding constraint. Such conterfactual work requires the use of a dispatch simulator, unlike higher-level observations which demonstrate the units have been constrained as opposed to what otherwise may have happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example provided assumes the reader has some foundational understanding of the NEM dispatch process, how constraints are defined, the types of constraints and so forth. Hence it can be seen as an intermediate example. Explainations of historical dispatch procedures in nempy are omitted given there is abundant information [covered in this example](https://nempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#detailed-recreation-of-historical-dispatch). To gain a thorough understanding of the work presented here, one should first understand simplier examples of NEM dispatch and have some insight as to how nempy can be used, as provided in [Nempy Documentation.](https://nempy.readthedocs.io/) Some helpful resources to assist in understanding constraints in the NEM are linked below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Acknowledgement:\n",
    "Special thanks to Nick Gorman at UNSW for developing the nempy tool and providing continued support in expanding it's functionality for the constraints analysis here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Context:\n",
    "This specific example demonstrates a timeseries constraints analysis and follows a previous example on constraints. It omits a fair amount of explaination which is covered in the earlier notebook and hence is more advanced. The reader should be well acquainted with constraints to digest the material here.\n",
